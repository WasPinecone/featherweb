    <p>ok so today i decided to actually cook instead of just scavenging bugs raw LULZ!! felt fancy for once</p>

    <p>found some small fish near the water path and a bunch of crunchy bugs in the rocks, thought why not combine them into one meal</p>

    <p>here’s my “adult Avian survival gourmet” recipe LULZ!!</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Ingredients:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>5-6 small fish (fresh is best)</li>
                <li>A handful of crunchy bugs (grasshoppers, beetles, whatever)</li>
                <li>Some moss or edible herbs for seasoning</li>
                <li>A splash of water for steaming</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Instructions:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Clean the fish carefully, remove scales if needed (watch claws, knives are scary!)</li>
                <li>Rinse the bugs in water, pick out the gross ones (legs sticking out too much LOL)</li>
                <li>Heat a flat rock over fire (or sun if available), place fish and bugs on it</li>
                <li>Sprinkle moss/herbs on top for flavor</li>
                <li>Cover with a bigger rock and steam with a little water for ~10 minutes</li>
                <li>Check if the bugs are crunchy and the fish is cooked (wiggly tails = raw!)</li>
                <li>Serve on a leaf plate, eat immediately, enjoy the crunch + flavor combo</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>pro tip: never cook near other Avians unless you want them begging for a bite LULZ!!</p>
    <p>end of day full belly and proud wings. next time maybe add shiny bugs for extra crunch flavor, maybe not LULZ!!</p>
