    <h1>Feathers Everywhere</h1>
    <p>ok so today was wild LULZ!! woke up in the usual nest spot, wings all messy. someone left seeds in my corner? not complaining but WHO EVEN DOES THAT haha</p>
    <p>spent like 3 hours hopping between rocks trying to catch bugs (FAILED) then kinda ran along the water path cuz water scares me but running on it is <span class="day-highlight">EPIC</span> not gonna lie</p>
    <p>found this shiny thing? idk what it is, probably useless. maybe a gift from the sky??? not touching it tho</p>
    <p>met a couple other Avians outside the tunnels, tried to say hi but accidentally screeched too loud LMAO. they ran away. </p>
    <p>ate some berries cuz hunger > pride. still prefer the crunchy stuff though YUM.</p>
    <p>ended the day staring at the dark ceiling pretending it’s the sky. tomorrow maybe more bugs, maybe more chaos, definitely more feathers. <span class="day-highlight">LULZ</span>!!</p>
