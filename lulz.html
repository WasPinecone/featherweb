    <p>ok woke up tangled in my own wings AGAIN lol feathers everywhere someone left random seeds in my corner? not mad but WHO EVEN DOES THAT</p>
    <p>tried hunting bugs for breakfast but ended up tripping over rocks for like 30 minutes (FAIL) ended up hopping on the water path cuz it scares me but running on it is <span class="highlight">EPIC</span> not even kidding</p>
    <p>found this weird shiny thing under moss idk if its treasure or a trap maybe a gift from the sky??? not touching it tho</p>
    <p>ran into some other Avians outside the tunnels tried saying hi but accidentally screeched too loud LMAO they bolted like I cursed them or something</p>
    <p>ate some berries cuz hunger > pride but still nothing beats crunchy bugs YUM</p>
    <p>spent like 2 hours exploring the upper tunnels found some glowing crystals kinda cool but scary if you stare too long almost fell into the shallow river LOL almost died still alive</p>
    <p>heard distant Avians fighting or screeching territorial stuff i dunno i just hid in a bush laughing quietly feathers on full alert</p>
    <p>came back to my nest sat staring at the ceiling pretending it’s sky best hobby ever maybe tomorrow i’ll try jumping off a ledge maybe not <span class="highlight">LULZ</span></p>
    <p>cleaned my feathers by splashing water on myself saves time and looks cool probably</p>
    <p>thinking about shiny things bugs running on water maybe i’m brave maybe reckless either way feathers everywhere goodnight world <span class="highlight">LULZ!!</span></p>
